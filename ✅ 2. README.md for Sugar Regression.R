# Blood Sugar Regression Project

This project aims to build and evaluate a linear regression model to predict blood sugar levels using multiple health-related variables.

## 🔍 Objective

To explore the association between blood sugar levels and key lifestyle or biological factors such as exercise, age, weight, and others.

## 📊 Methodology

- Data preprocessing and filtering using `tidyverse`
- Regression modeling using `lm()` with stepwise selection
- Coefficient and Diagnostic plots
- Metrics used: RMSE, Adjusted R²

## 📈 Results

- The model shows moderate fit
- Diagnostic plots suggest acceptable assumptions
- Results are interpretable and reproducible

## 🚀 How to Run

Open each script in RStudio and execute in order:
1. `01_cleaning.R`
2. `02_model_building.R`
3. `03_diagnostics.R`

## 🛠️ Built With

- R
- ggplot2
- broom
- dplyr
- tidymodels
